This Haskell code attempts to use a function that isn't imported, leading to a compile-time error.  The error message will be cryptic unless the programmer knows to check imports.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = print $ length [1..10]
```

The `length` function is part of the `Data.List` module and needs to be imported.
